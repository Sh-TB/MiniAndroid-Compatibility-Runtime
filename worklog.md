# Multi-Agent Shared Worklog — MiniAndroid-Compatibility-Runtime

NOTE: this shared log was wiped by the S38 mid-session container reset and is
recreated from the S38 record onward. Git-tracked session history lives in
`docs/maintenance/worklog.md` (authoritative); commit messages on origin/main
carry the per-session detail (S16..S37 at HEAD 73a84aad).

---
Task ID: S38-MAIN
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: MASTER CAMPAIGN 3 continuation — publish old pushes; JPG evidence conversion
(user directive: JPG <=100KB, not PNG); Hello World archive expansion (advanced
fixtures); wave-4 reruns of S37 budget-timeouts; R-NEW-335 shift-law probe;
root audit.

Work Log:
- Published pushes: server main verified at 73a84aad; local main synced (0 unpushed).
- S38-A (done twice — container reset mid-session): all 31 ledger evidence images
  converted PNG->JPG (540x960, q72, hellocolor q60), every image <=100KB
  (max 89KB), total 287KB; ledger references updated, zero stale refs.
  Deterministic: second-run JPG SHAs byte-identical to first-run.
- CONTAINER RESET mid-session (tools/ + build/ + all untracked files + local
  refs rolled back to 7a172e7c): recovered via `git fetch + reset --hard
  origin/main` (server main = 73a84aad intact). Re-fetched toolchain (ecj
  3.36.0 Maven Central, r8 8.3.37 r8-releases, android-34 Sable, aapt2 Google
  Maven). All S38 untracked work re-created from session context.
- AUDIT FINDING: S36/S37 commit messages claimed "registry 321->322" but the
  registry file in git stayed at 303 roots until S37's actual committed state
  (recovered 73a84aad registry = 322 roots, last R-NEW-335 — verified true).
  Shared worklog text vs committed file discrepancy documented.
- hello_widgets (Advanced Hello World #3) + hello_smoke (Advanced #2) built
  aapt2-linked and executed (pre-reset evidence): both SUCCESS with real
  multi-widget renders; hello_widgets = most advanced View-world render in the
  archive (ImageView drawable + EditText + Button + TableLayout 3 rows +
  RelativeLayout layout_below, 35.5% non-background).
- R-NEW-336 registered (P1): post-click setText on a TextView under a
  ScrollView root renders empty (default text vanishes); identical chain under
  LinearLayout root renders (hello_smoke count=1). Isolated: not concat, not
  getText, not invalidate. Structural delta = ScrollView root.
- R-NEW-335 probe: s38_shift_law fixture (7 laws, 26 checks) replicating the
  exact androidx.collection ScatterMap long-arithmetic (writeRawMetadata/
  readRawMetadata/group() guard/hash MurmurHashC1 chain/convertMetadata/
  neg+shr63 guard), anti-constant-folded via non-final statics, hardcoded
  expected values from independent big-int computation, visual verdict bands.
  APK 1a82564691a248b8d2d0be363d5986c1e171ca886acd1e36656f2c1f3550a6f1.
  Run pending runtime binary rebuild (make -j2 in progress after reset).
- wave-4 script re-created: 4 S37 budget-timeouts re-queued at 900s + 2 hello
  fixtures + shift-law probe first.

Stage Summary:
- Registry 322->323 (R-NEW-336). Evidence images: 31 JPG <=100KB.
- Root audit delivered: 103 PARTIAL / 72 UNPROVEN / 4 OBSERVED-FAIL /
  16 RESEARCHED-NOT-IMPLEMENTED remaining; P0 frontier = R-NEW-335 (dooz AIOOBE)
  + R-NEW-301/303/242/246/256/259/261/279/281/285 compose/lifecycle family.
- Next: run shift-law probe verdict -> R-NEW-335 verdict (engine-vs-dual-store);
  wave-4 runs; ledger S38 section; push; report progress %.
